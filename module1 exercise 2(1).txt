css/ — Styles for your website
This folder contains the look and feel of Bootstrap. These files style buttons, layouts, text, etc.

bootstrap.css: Full version, easy to read. Good for learning or development.

bootstrap.min.css: Same as above but minified (smaller and faster). Best for live websites.

bootstrap.rtl.css: For right-to-left languages (like Arabic or Hebrew).

.map files: Help browsers debug CSS by showing original code when using the minified version.

js/ — Makes things interactive
This folder contains the JavaScript that powers interactive Bootstrap components like:

Modals (popups)

Dropdowns

Tooltips

Offcanvas menus

Files:

bootstrap.bundle.min.js: Includes Bootstrap + Popper.js (which is needed for tooltips, popovers, etc.). This is the one you usually use.

bootstrap.min.js: Bootstrap JavaScript without Popper.

bootstrap.js: Same as above, but not minified (for debugging or learning).
icons/ (optional, if downloaded separately) — Visual symbols
If you download Bootstrap Icons, you’ll get this folder. It contains:

bootstrap-icons.css: Lets you use icons with classes like <i class="bi bi-heart"></i>.

Icon font files like .woff, .woff2, and .svg.

These are great for adding visual symbols (like hearts, stars, etc.) to your site without using image files.
